			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Make marinade: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon chili powder, and salt; stir to evenly coat chicken. Cover the dish and let marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.</li>
	
				<li>Line a strainer with cheesecloth. Place yogurt in the strainer and allow it to drain for 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer drained yogurt to a medium bowl. Mix remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oil, garlic paste, ginger paste, melted butter, remaining 1 tablespoon chili powder, and garam masala into yogurt until well combined. Pour yogurt mixture over chicken, cover the dish, and refrigerate once more to marinate for 3 to 4 hours.</li>
	
				<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
	
				<li>Place chicken on skewers; arrange in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
	
				<li>Bake in the preheated oven until almost cooked through, about 20 minutes.</li>
	
				<li>Make sauce: Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garam masala. When masala begins to crackle, mix in ginger paste, garlic, and green chile pepper. Sauté until tender, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in tomato purée, water, chili powder, and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring in honey and fenugreek.</li>
	
				<li>Remove par-cooked chicken from skewers and place into sauce in the pan. Continue cooking until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Stir in cream until incorporated.</li>
